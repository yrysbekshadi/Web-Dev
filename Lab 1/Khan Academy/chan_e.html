        <p>The <em>butterfly</em> is awesome because <strong> everything about it comes together perfectly: its wings have bright colors and balanced patterns that our eyes naturally enjoy, it moves lightly and quietly as if it doesn’t rush anywhere, it appears only for a short moment which makes it feel special, and we know it was once a caterpillar, so its transformation makes its beauty even more meaningful.</strong>.</p>
